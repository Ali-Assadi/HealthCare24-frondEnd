        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Progressive Overload:</b> Gradually increase the intensity,
            duration, or difficulty of your workouts over time to continue
            challenging your body and seeing results. This can involve
            increasing repetitions, sets, holding exercises for longer, or using
            resistance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Proper Form:</b> Focus on executing each exercise with correct
            technique to maximize muscle engagement and prevent injuries. If
            you're unsure about form, watch reliable online tutorials or
            consider a virtual consultation with a trainer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Variety:</b> Incorporate a mix of different exercises that target
            various muscle groups to ensure balanced development and prevent

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Proper Warm-up and Cool-down:</b> Always begin your workouts with
            a dynamic warm-up to prepare your muscles for exercise and end with
            static stretching to improve flexibility and reduce muscle soreness.
          </li>
        </ul>
