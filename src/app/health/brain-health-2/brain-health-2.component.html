        <p>Studies suggest that women tend to live longer than men. This phenomenon is due to a combination of biological, social, and lifestyle factors. While genetics play a role, other lifestyle and environmental factors significantly impact the average life expectancy of women compared to men.</p>

        <!-- Biological Factors Section -->
        <h2>1. Biological Factors</h2>
        <p>One of the primary reasons women live longer than men is the difference in biological and genetic factors. Research has shown that women generally have a stronger immune system compared to men, which helps them fight off infections and diseases more effectively. Furthermore, womenâ€™s bodies are better equipped to handle stress and repair cellular damage, which can contribute to their longer lifespans.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, women tend to have higher levels of estrogen, which has been shown to have protective cardiovascular effects. Estrogen helps to reduce the risk of heart disease, a major cause of death worldwide. As men age, their testosterone levels decrease, which can make them more vulnerable to certain health issues.</p>

        <!-- Lifestyle Choices Section -->
        <h2>2. Lifestyle Choices</h2>
        <p>Lifestyle choices play a significant role in longevity, and women often make healthier choices than men. Studies have found that women are more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors such as regular exercise, healthier eating habits, and avoiding risky behaviors like excessive alcohol consumption or smoking.</p>

        <p>Women are also more likely to visit healthcare providers for regular check-ups, which leads to early detection and treatment of potential health issues. In contrast, men are generally less likely to seek medical help, which can lead to the late diagnosis of serious health conditions.</p>

        <!-- Social Support and Stress Management Section -->
        <h2>3. Social Support and Stress Management</h2>
        <p>Social connections and emotional well-being are essential factors in longevity. Women often have stronger social networks than men, providing them with better emotional support, which is crucial for reducing stress and improving overall health.</p>

        <p>Women are generally better at expressing their emotions and managing stress. Social interactions and emotional resilience help women cope with life's challenges, which can lead to a lower risk of chronic illnesses like depression, heart disease, and high blood pressure.</p>

        <!-- Genetics and Evolution Section -->
        <h2>4. Genetics and Evolution</h2>
        <p>Genetics also play a significant role in the difference in life expectancy between men and women. Female genetics may offer a natural advantage when it comes to surviving certain diseases and conditions. For example, women have two X chromosomes, which provide a backup in case one is damaged, whereas men only have one X chromosome, making them more vulnerable to certain genetic disorders.</p>

        <p>From an evolutionary standpoint, women have evolved to live longer in part due to their roles in reproduction and nurturing. Evolution has favored women who are able to live long enough to care for offspring and pass on their genetic material to future generations.</p>
