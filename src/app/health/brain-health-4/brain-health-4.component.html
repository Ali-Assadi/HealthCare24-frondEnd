            <h2>What is Memory?</h2>
            <p>Memory is the mental faculty of retaining and recalling past experiences. It is crucial for learning, decision-making, and daily functioning. Our memory allows us to build knowledge, form relationships, and navigate the world around us effectively.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Memory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short-Term Memory:</strong> Holds information temporarily for quick retrieval, lasting only a few seconds to minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Memory:</strong> Stores information permanently, enabling us to remember past experiences, knowledge, and skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Procedural Memory:</strong> Involves motor skills and habitual tasks, such as riding a bicycle or typing on a keyboard.</li>
                <li><strong>Declarative Memory:</strong> Stores facts, dates, and events, helping us recall information consciously.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Memory Loss</h2>
            <p>Memory loss refers to the inability to recall past experiences or retain new information. It can be temporary or permanent and affects people differently depending on the cause and severity.</p>
            
            <h3>Causes of Memory Loss</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aging and cognitive decline:</strong> Natural aging processes may lead to forgetfulness and slower memory recall.</li>
                <li><strong>Stress and anxiety:</strong> High-stress levels can impact focus and retention.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep deprivation:</strong> Poor sleep habits hinder memory consolidation.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurological disorders like Alzheimer's:</strong> Progressive diseases that cause severe memory impairment.</li>
                <li><strong>Head trauma or injury:</strong> Accidents leading to brain damage can affect memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Substance abuse:</strong> Excessive alcohol and drug use can damage brain function.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How to Improve Memory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Engage in regular physical activity to boost brain function.</li>
                <li>Follow a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids.</li>
                <li>Practice mental exercises like puzzles, chess, and reading.</li>
                <li>Ensure adequate sleep to support memory consolidation.</li>
                <li>Reduce stress through meditation, yoga, and relaxation techniques.</li>
                <li>Maintain social interactions and continuously learn new skills.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>When to Seek Help</h3>
            <p>If memory loss becomes frequent, severe, or affects daily life, consulting a medical professional is crucial. Early diagnosis and intervention can slow the progression of certain conditions.</p>
