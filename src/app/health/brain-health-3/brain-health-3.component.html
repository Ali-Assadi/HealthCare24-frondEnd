            <h2>Understanding the Link Between Cholesterol and Dementia</h2>
            <p>Recent studies have indicated that fluctuations in cholesterol levels, especially in midlife, may be associated with an increased risk of dementia later in life. Maintaining healthy cholesterol levels could play a crucial role in brain health.</p>
            
            <h3>How Cholesterol Affects Brain Function</h3>
            <p>Cholesterol is essential for the brain, helping to build cell membranes and facilitate nerve signaling. However, high levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol and low levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol can contribute to plaque buildup in blood vessels, increasing the risk of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Findings from Research</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Higher LDL cholesterol levels have been linked to cognitive decline.</li>
                <li>Individuals with fluctuating cholesterol levels are at a greater risk of developing dementia.</li>
                <li>Healthy lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise, can help maintain balanced cholesterol levels.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ways to Maintain Healthy Cholesterol Levels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Eat a diet rich in healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, and fish.</li>
                <li>Exercise regularly to improve cardiovascular and brain health.</li>
                <li>Monitor cholesterol levels and consult a doctor if changes occur.</li>
            </ul>
