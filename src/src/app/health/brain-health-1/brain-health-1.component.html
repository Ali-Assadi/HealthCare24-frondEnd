        <p><strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong> is a progressive brain disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It’s the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all dementia cases.</p>
        
        <p>Over time, individuals with Alzheimer's experience a decline in cognitive abilities, which impacts their ability to perform everyday tasks. The disease typically affects older adults, and the risk increases with age, but it is not a normal part of aging.</p>
        
        <h3>Genetic Component</h3>
        <p>Alzheimer’s disease does have a genetic component, but it is not entirely hereditary. While certain genes can increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's, having a family history of the disease doesn't guarantee that you will develop it.</p>
        
        <h3>The Role of Genes</h3>
        <p>The most well-known gene linked to Alzheimer's is the <strong>APOE-e4 gene</strong>. People who inherit one copy of this gene have an increased risk, while those with two copies have an even higher risk. However, not everyone who carries this gene develops Alzheimer’s.</p>
        
        <h3>Late-Onset Alzheimer’s</h3>
        <p>The most common form of Alzheimer’s is <strong>late-onset Alzheimer’s</strong>, which typically occurs after age 65. It is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.</p>
        
        <h3>Early-Onset Alzheimer’s</h3>
        <p>Some individuals develop Alzheimer’s at a younger age, typically between their 30s and mid-60s. This is known as <strong>early-onset Alzheimer's</strong> and is more often linked to inherited genetic mutations.</p>
        
        <h3>Reducing the Risk</h3>
        <p>While there is no guaranteed way to prevent Alzheimer’s, research suggests that certain lifestyle changes may help reduce the risk:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stay mentally active:</strong> Engaging in brain-stimulating activities may help maintain cognitive function.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise regularly:</strong> Physical activity promotes blood flow to the brain.</li>
            <li><strong>Eat a healthy diet:</strong> A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats can improve brain health.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage chronic conditions:</strong> Controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes can lower risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay socially connected:</strong> Social interaction can reduce stress and improve cognitive function.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Ongoing Research</h3>
        <p>Researchers are continuously studying Alzheimer’s disease to develop new treatments and prevention methods.</p>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>While Alzheimer's remains an incurable disease, understanding genetic and lifestyle factors can help individuals take preventive measures.</p>
